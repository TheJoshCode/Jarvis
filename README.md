# Features
- Voice Interaction: Communicate with the AI using your microphone.

- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Responses are spoken out loud using pyttsx3 for a natural interaction experience.
  
- Local Operation: Runs entirely on your machine, no internet required once set up.
  
- Flexible AI Model: Dynamically detects and uses the active LM Studio model for responses.
